# Tech Labor Insights — Interactive Labor Market Map

## Problem Framing
Understanding regional labor trends is critical for workforce planning, economic policy, and career decision-making.  
While public BLS data provides valuable insights, it’s often fragmented across multiple sources and difficult to visualize effectively.

## Goal
Create an interactive tool that combines and visualizes key U.S. labor metrics — such as unemployment rates and occupational wages — to make complex data more accessible to policymakers, educators, and job seekers.

## Approach
This project integrates data from the **Bureau of Labor Statistics (LAUS and OEWS)** APIs, processes it for consistency, and displays the results on an interactive **Leaflet.js** map.  
Users can explore regional differences, view wage distributions, and analyze local employment trends through color-coded choropleths and dynamic charts.

## Key Concepts
- **Data Integration:** Automated retrieval and normalization of multi-source BLS data.  
- **Visualization:** Real-time mapping with Leaflet.js and Chart.js for geographic and statistical insights.  
- **Accessibility:** A web-based interface designed for clarity and interactive exploration.

## Summary
Tech Labor Insights demonstrates how data engineering and visualization can transform raw economic datasets into actionable, intuitive insights.  
It showcases skills in API integration, data cleaning, and front-end visualization for data-driven decision support.
